A Python code for my high school students about the radioactive decay to make studying nuclear physics funnier (I hope that !).  
To run the code, python must be installed with the librairies numpy, csv and matplotlib. Run this commande line :  
`python3 radioactivity.py`  
  
Will be included later simulations on the decay modes (alpha, beta and gamma) as well as the calculation of the energies of Fission and Fusion.  
  
If there are any questions or remarks, feel free to send an email to : zackaria.daoudi@gmail.com
